# Tic-Tac-Toe

Game of Tic-Tac-Toe I developed within 2 months of learning C#

Features 1P vs. IA and 2P game modes.
The AI has 3 different difficulty modes, with the hardes playing to win or tie.

Other implementations are a coin throw at the beginning of the game to decide who starts and a visual board with ASCII characters.

The game was developed following defensive coding practices.

The latest version of .NET Framework is needed.
